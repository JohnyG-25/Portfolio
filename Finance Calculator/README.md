# **Capstone Project 1**
### **Creating a finance calculator**

### **Instructions**

We were instructed to code in python a program to calculate a bond or investment. 

### **Method**
This program would take the user input on what the user would to to achieve (bond or investment)

Should the choice be Bond, the user would input the following
  Total value of the house
  The interest rate
  The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond
 
The program would then calculate how much money the user will have to repay each month, and output that answer 


Should the choice be Investment, the user would input the following
  Total that the user would like to deposit
  The interest rate
  The number of years they plan on investing for
  Simple or compound interest


The program would then calculate how much money they would recieve after a given amount of time.
