# **Capstone Project 2**
### **Expanding upon the task management program**

### **Instructions**

We were instructed to expand upon our previous project. 
This included moving everything over to functions, creating additional stat systems, and allowing for more optionso in the menu

### **Method**

I created the origianal project with functions, as that was the best way I knew how to do a project like this. 
As such, I had little difficulty converting my functions to the functions they requested.

I set up new functions to generate user and task stats. Such things like "Overdue tasks, Incomplete tasks, etc. 
These reports were then generated, and saved to task_overview and user_overview. 

These reports were viewable via the menu, as the final request for this project
