# **Task management program**
### **Creating a task management program**

### **Instructions**

We were instructed to code in python a program that users and admins could use to manage tasks for a small business

### **Method**

Step 1 would request the user to sign in. This would result in 1 of three things

    A. A standerd user would sign in
    B. An admin would sign in
    C. A non registered user would be unable to sign in
  
Step 2 would depend on what user has signed in
All users would have the ability to do the following via a menu:

    Add a new task
    View all tasks
    View all tasks specific to the user signed in
    Exit
    Logout
  
Admins would have the additional options given to them:

    Adding a new user
    Viewing the entire list of users
    Getting stats for the entire system
  
All of these details would be kept in 2 text files. Users.txt and tasks.txt.
Users.txt would contain a list of usernames and passwords
Tasks contain the following information on each task:

    Who the task is assigned to
    What the task is
    When the task was submitted
    When the task should be completed by
    If the task is completed
    
 The stats option for admins give the following information
 
    Total users
    A list of users
    The total count of tasks
